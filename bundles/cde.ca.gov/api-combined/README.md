Compilation of multiple years of California Academic Performance Index scores into single files. 

This dataset includes two files that combine multiple years of the [California Academic Performance Index](http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/ap/) into single CSV files. These files have a few advantages over the oroginal data releases from The California Department of Education:

* Multiple years of records are combined into a single file
* Files are converted to CSV format to be useful with a wider range of software tools
* Column names are normalized to be consistent across years
* Data is presented in a consistent schema, with some erroneous values removed

If you do not need to analyze multiple years and can work with fixed with text or DBF files, the original, single-year source files may be more appropriate. 

** This data is a beta release, and has not been fully verified for fidelity with the upstream source. Use with caution. **

This file and the attached __schema.csv__ and __documentation.html__ files describe the changes made to the original files in this compilation.  See the [California Department of Education website]({website}) for complete documentation on the data in these datasets.
